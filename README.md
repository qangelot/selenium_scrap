Using Selenium (testing library) to access data and do dynamic stuffs on websites :

- get trip advisor reviews
- get indeed job posting
- automate linkedin job offer
- add instagram followers

Selenium allows to handle dynamic elements on the website, which is not possible with Beautiful Soup (click elements, fill in forms...)
